    <h2>Executive Summary / Self Description</h2>
    <p>
        I had been working for Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) for 13 years in Functional Test (FCT). I also had been working on Setting up, Testing and Scripting software for FCT or Production testing. I had been working on Cisco products; for example, CISCO10K, and LAN switches. I supported Cisco Engineers on both sites (San Jose, CA USA and Thailand). 
    </p>
    <p>
        From my working experience that working from ground zero to management (manpower and planning), I was leader in regression team working on automation test to set up the new test team, improve test process and reduce project cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently I had been working in IT (Business Systems and Service Desks to support users and customers) in Automotive Part Manufacturing. Now I’m looking for new opportunity to work in any job opportunities. I have confident that I can use my experience and myself interested in technology. I also like to share my knowledge what I have been working that can help team to meet the team target.
